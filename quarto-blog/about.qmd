## About Me

I'm Rakshit Sakhuja, passionate about Machine Learning and AI technologies.

## About This Blog

This blog is powered by [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and contains my notes, experiments, and insights on:

- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning  
- Azure ML Services
- Data Science
- AI Research

One of the beautiful things about Machine Learning is you are not going to remember a lot of details if you are not practicing it - hence this blog serves as my external memory!
